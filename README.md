# NET_PRACTICE
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

# DEFINITION: COMPUTER NETWORK
A computer network is a system of interconnected **nodes** (devices such as computers, servers, and other networking equipment) that **communicate** with each other to share resources and information. These networks can be wired or wireless and operate using protocols that govern data transmission, security, and access.

## Key components of a computer network:
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers, phones, or servers capable of sending/receving data generated by other nodes in the network. We have:
	- **end node (also known as a host)**: any device at the edge of a network that either initiates or receives communication. These devices are typically the sources or destinations of the data being transmitted
	- **intermediate node**: a device within the network that helps route data between end nodes. These nodes don't originate or consume the data but instead forward it from one place to another to ensure it reaches its destination

- **Communication links**: The physical or wireless connections (e.g., cables, radio waves) that allow data to be transmitted between nodes.
- **Switches and routers**: Devices that manage data traffic and direct it between different parts of the network.
- **Protocols**: Standardized rules (like TCP/IP) that dictate how data is transmitted and received.

# BASIC CHARACTERISTICS
Here’s a breakdown of the basic characteristics of a computer network

- **Fault Tolerance**: Fault tolerance is the ability of a network to continue 
  operating smoothly, even when one or more components fail.
  - Networks achieve this by having redundant systems, meaning there are backups 
    or alternative pathways for data to flow if one part of the network fails.

- **Scalability**: Scalability refers to the network's ability to grow and manage 
  increased demand without sacrificing performance.
  (An example of scalable network is Internet)

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: QoS is the ability to prioritize certain types 
  of network traffic to ensure performance for critical applications.
  - In a network, different types of data (like voice, video, and regular file transfers) 
    compete for bandwidth. QoS ensures that time-sensitive data (e.g., voice or video calls) 
	gets priority over less critical traffic (e.g., file downloads).
	This can be achieved by traffic shaping, bandwidth reservation, and traffic prioritization.

- **Security**: Security refers to the measures taken to protect the network 
  from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.


# NETWORK PROTOCOLS & COMUNICATIONS
## What is Data Comunication?
Data communication is the exchange of data between nodes (such as computers, servers, smartphones, etc.) 
over a transmission medium (or link).

## Understand data flow
Data flow describes the direction in which data is transmitted between devices. T
here are three types:
- **Simplex**: Data flows in only one direction. For example, in a keyboard-to-computer 
  connection, the keyboard sends data to the computer, but the computer doesn’t send data back.
- **Half-Duplex**: Data can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time. 
  Walkie-talkies are a good example of this.
- **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions at the same time. A common example 
  is a telephone conversation where both people can speak and listen simultaneously.

## Protocols in computer network
- **Definition**: Protocols are a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
  These rules ensure that devices can communicate with each other reliably and consistently.
- **Why they are important**:
	- **Interoperability**: Protocols ensure that devices from different manufacturers or platforms can communicate. For example, TCP/IP is the protocol used for communication over the internet, allowing millions of different devices to connect.
	- **Error Handling**: Protocols provide methods for detecting and correcting errors during transmission, ensuring that data is received accurately.
	- **Flow Control**: They regulate how fast data can be sent and received, preventing a fast sender from overwhelming a slower receiver.
	- **Security**: Many protocols include encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data as it moves across a network.
- **Example protocols**:
	- **HTTP**: Used for transmitting web pages.
	- **TCP/IP**: The fundamental protocol suite for internet communication.
	- **FTP**: Used for transferring files between a client and server.
	- **SMTP**: Used for sending emails.

### Elements of protocol
Protocols used in network communications define:
- **Message Encoding**: Message encoding is the process of converting data into a format that can be transmitted over a network.
  (Protocols like ASCII or Unicode are used for encoding text, while audio and video have their own encoding standards (e.g., MP3, MPEG).)
- **Message Formatting & Encapsulation**:
	- **Message Formatting**: Refers to the specific structure that a message must follow 
	  to be properly understood by the receiving system. It involves organizing the 
	  data into sections such as headers, footers, and payloads.
	  For instance, an email protocol like SMTP has a header (sender, receiver, subject) and a body (message content).
	- **Encapsulation**: This refers to wrapping data with protocol-specific information as 
	  it moves through different layers of the network (according to the OSI model).
	  For example, when sending data over the internet, a message is encapsulated 
	  with IP headers, then TCP/UDP headers, and finally, the application-specific headers (like HTTP).
	  At each step, new information is added to help the message reach its destination and be understood properly.
- **Message Timing**: Message timing refers to when and how fast data is sent between devices.
	- **Flow Control**: Ensures that data is sent at a rate that the receiver can handle, preventing data loss or overload.
	- **Response Time**: iming protocols define how quickly a receiver must acknowledge receipt of a message, preventing unnecessary delays.
	- **Synchronization**: iming protocols define how quickly a receiver must acknowledge receipt of a message, preventing unnecessary delays.
- **Message Size**: Message size refers to how large a data packet can be when sent across the network.
  Different networks have limits on how much data can be transmitted at once. For example, 
  Ethernet networks often use a maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of around 1500 bytes.
- **Message Delivery Options**: This refers to how data is delivered to the recipient. There are three primary options:
	- **Unicast**: Data is sent from one sender to one specific receiver. This is the most common form of communication, such as sending an email or visiting a website.
	- **Multicast**: Data is sent from one sender to multiple specific receivers. An example is streaming media to multiple users in a private group.
	- **Broadcast**: Data is sent from one sender to all devices on a network. This is often used in local networks to send data like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.

## Peer to Peer Network
A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is a type of computer network where each device (or node) 
has equal responsibilities and capabilities, allowing them to communicate directly 
with one another without relying on a central server. In P2P networks, devices act 
as both clients and servers, meaning they can both request and provide resources, 
such as files, data, or services.
- No centralized administration
- All peers are equal
- Simple sharing applications
- Not scalable

## Client Server Network
A Client-Server Network is a network architecture in which there is a clear distinction 
between devices (or nodes) called clients and a central device called the server. 
In this model, clients request services, resources, or data, and the server provides them. 
The client-server model is widely used in many applications, such as websites, 
email systems, and databases.

**Key Characteristics**
- **Centralized Control**: In a client-server network, one or more servers act as centralized points for managing resources, such as files, databases, applications, or services.
- **Request-Response Model**: Clients send requests to the server for services, such as accessing a web page, querying a database, or sending an email.
  The server processes these requests and responds with the necessary information or action. For example, if a client requests a file, the server will send it back to the client.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**:
	- **Server**: The server is a powerful computer or group of computers that handle requests from clients. It provides services such as file storage, email handling, or web hosting. Servers usually run specialized software designed to manage network resources efficiently.
	- **Client**: The client is any device (e.g., a PC, smartphone, or tablet) that connects to the server to access resources or perform tasks. Clients rely on the server to process requests and provide the required services or data.
- **Efficiency and Resource Sharing**: Servers consolidate resources such as databases, applications, files, and printers, allowing multiple clients to access and share these resources efficiently.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is scalable because more clients can connect 
  to the server as needed. Servers can also be upgraded (e.g., adding more storage, memory, 
  or processing power) to handle growing demand.

# CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
Computer networks can be classified based on their geographic coverage, size, 
and the purpose they serve. The most common classifications are LAN (Local Area Network), 
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network). 
Each type has distinct characteristics in terms of size, speed, and technology used.

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
	- **Definition**: A Local Area Network is a network that covers a small geographic area, such as a single building, office, or home. It is typically used to connect computers and devices within close proximity for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections.
	- **Characteristics**
		- **Geographic Area**: Limited to a small area (e.g., a room, a building, or a campus).
		- **Ownership**: Usually owned and managed by a single organization or individual.
		- **Speed**: High-speed networks (ranging from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or more).
		- **Technology**: Common technologies include Ethernet (wired LAN) and Wi-Fi (wireless LAN).
		- **example**: 
			- Wired LAN: Ethernet - Hub,Switches
			- Wireless LAN: Wi-Fi

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
	- **Definition**: A Metropolitan Area Network is a network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN, typically the size of a city or a metropolitan region. It interconnects multiple LANs within a city or town, allowing for resource sharing across larger distances.
	- **Characteristics**
		- **Geographic Area**: Covers an area of a few kilometers to tens of kilometers, typically within a city or a large town.
		- **Ownership**:  Can be owned by a single organization or shared by multiple organizations, often managed by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) or telecom companies.
