# NET_PRACTICE
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.


# SUBNETTING
Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets). This improves the efficiency of IP address usage and allows for better network resource management.

## Objectives of Subnetting
1. IP Address Optimization: Reduces the waste of IP addresses.
2. Improved Performance: Limits the size of broadcast domains.
3. Enhanced Security and Organization: Isolates different network segments.


## How Subnetting Works
1. IP Address An IP address consists of two main parts:
	- Network ID: Identifies the network.
	- Host ID: Identifies a device within the network.

For example, in 192.168.1.10/24:
	- 192.168.1 is the Network ID.
	- 10 is the Host ID.
	- /24 indicates that the first 24 bits are reserved for the Network ID (subnet mask: 255.255.255.0).

2. Subnet Mask The subnet mask determines which bits of the address are reserved for the Network ID and which for the Host ID. Common subnet masks include:
	- /24 → 255.255.255.0 (256 addresses, 254 usable hosts)
	- /16 → 255.255.0.0 (65,536 addresses, 65,534 usable hosts)
	- /8 → 255.0.0.0 (16,777,216 addresses, 16,777,214 usable hosts)

3. Network Division Subnetting is done by reducing the number of bits available for hosts and increasing the bits for subnets. For example:
- Starting with 192.168.1.0/24, we can split it into two subnets:
	- 192.168.1.0/25 (128 addresses, 126 usable hosts)
	- 192.168.1.128/25 (128 addresses, 126 usable hosts)


## Practical Example
Let’s assume we have a network with 192.168.1.0/24 and want to divide it into 4 subnets.

1. Determine the number of subnets needed:
	- 4 subnets require at least 2 additional bits to represent them (2² = 4).
2. Adjust the subnet mask:
	- from: 255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
	- to: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 -> I took the 2 necessary bits starting from the left (on the network side).
	- /24 becomes /26 (255.255.255.192).
3. Calculate the ranges: 2^m (where 𝑚 is the number of bits remaining for hosts) 
	- Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63
	- Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127
	- Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191
	- Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255


Each subnet has:
- 64 total addresses.
- 62 usable addresses for hosts (excluding network and broadcast addresses).

## Calculate the range od IP addresses
To calculate the range of IP addresses and determine how many hosts you have per subnet, you need to follow a step-by-step process. Here’s how:

1. **Understand the Subnet Mask**
The subnet mask tells you how many bits are reserved for the network and how many are available for hosts:
- In /26 (255.255.255.192):
	- 26 bits are for the network.
 	- 32−26=6 bits are for the host portion.
 
2. **Calculate the Total Addresses Per Subnet**
The total number of addresses in a subnet is determined by the formula:  **2^n**
Where n is the number of bits in the host portion. For /26, 𝑛 = 6:
2^6 = 64 addresses per subnet.

3. **Calculate the Usable Hosts Per Subnet**
To find the usable host addresses, subtract the network address and the broadcast address from the total:
**2^n -2**

4. **Determine the Range of IP Addresses**
Each subnet has a block size of 2^𝑛 = 64 addresses. The range is calculated as follows:
- The first IP in the range is the network address (all host bits set to 0).
- The last IP is the broadcast address (all host bits set to 1).
- The usable range is from the first usable host to the last usable host.

## Useful Calculations
- **Number of subnets**: **2^𝑛**, where 𝑛 is the number of bits added to the subnet mask.
- **Number of hosts per subnet**: **2^𝑚 - 2** , where 𝑚 is the number of bits remaining for hosts.
