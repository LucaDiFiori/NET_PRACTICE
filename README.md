# NET_PRACTICE
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

# DEFINITION: COMPUTER NETWORK
A computer network is a system of interconnected **nodes** (devices such as computers, servers, and other networking equipment) that **communicate** with each other to share resources and information. These networks can be wired or wireless and operate using protocols that govern data transmission, security, and access.

## Key components of a computer network:
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers, phones, or servers capable of sending/receving data generated by other nodes in the network.
- **Communication links**: The physical or wireless connections (e.g., cables, radio waves) that allow data to be transmitted between nodes.
- **Switches and routers**: Devices that manage data traffic and direct it between different parts of the network.
- **Protocols**: Standardized rules (like TCP/IP) that dictate how data is transmitted and received.
