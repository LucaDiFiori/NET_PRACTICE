# NET_PRACTICE
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

# DEFINITION: COMPUTER NETWORK
A computer network is a system of interconnected **nodes** (devices such as computers, servers, and other networking equipment) that **communicate** with each other to share resources and information. These networks can be wired or wireless and operate using protocols that govern data transmission, security, and access.

## Key components of a computer network:
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers, phones, or servers capable of sending/receving data generated by other nodes in the network. We have:
	- **end node (also known as a host)**: any device at the edge of a network that either initiates or receives communication. These devices are typically the sources or destinations of the data being transmitted
	- **intermediate node**: a device within the network that helps route data between end nodes. These nodes don't originate or consume the data but instead forward it from one place to another to ensure it reaches its destination

- **Communication links**: The physical or wireless connections (e.g., cables, radio waves) that allow data to be transmitted between nodes.
- **Switches and routers**: Devices that manage data traffic and direct it between different parts of the network.
- **Protocols**: Standardized rules (like TCP/IP) that dictate how data is transmitted and received.

# BASIC CHARACTERISTICS
Here’s a breakdown of the basic characteristics of a computer network

- **Fault Tolerance**: Fault tolerance is the ability of a network to continue 
  operating smoothly, even when one or more components fail.
  - Networks achieve this by having redundant systems, meaning there are backups 
    or alternative pathways for data to flow if one part of the network fails.

- **Scalability**: Scalability refers to the network's ability to grow and manage 
  increased demand without sacrificing performance.
  (An example of scalable network is Internet)

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: QoS is the ability to prioritize certain types 
  of network traffic to ensure performance for critical applications.
  - In a network, different types of data (like voice, video, and regular file transfers) 
    compete for bandwidth. QoS ensures that time-sensitive data (e.g., voice or video calls) 
	gets priority over less critical traffic (e.g., file downloads).
	This can be achieved by traffic shaping, bandwidth reservation, and traffic prioritization.

- **Security**: Security refers to the measures taken to protect the network 
  from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.


# NETWORK PROTOCOLS & COMUNICATIONS
## What is Data Comunication?
Data communication is the exchange of data between nodes (such as computers, servers, smartphones, etc.) 
over a transmission medium (or link).

## Understand data flow
Data flow describes the direction in which data is transmitted between devices. T
here are three types:
- **Simplex**: Data flows in only one direction. For example, in a keyboard-to-computer 
  connection, the keyboard sends data to the computer, but the computer doesn’t send data back.
- **Half-Duplex**: Data can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time. 
  Walkie-talkies are a good example of this.
- **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions at the same time. A common example 
  is a telephone conversation where both people can speak and listen simultaneously.

## Protocols in computer network
- **Definition**: Protocols are a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
  These rules ensure that devices can communicate with each other reliably and consistently.
- **Why they are important**:
	- **Interoperability**: Protocols ensure that devices from different manufacturers or platforms can communicate. For example, TCP/IP is the protocol used for communication over the internet, allowing millions of different devices to connect.
	- **Error Handling**: Protocols provide methods for detecting and correcting errors during transmission, ensuring that data is received accurately.
	- **Flow Control**: They regulate how fast data can be sent and received, preventing a fast sender from overwhelming a slower receiver.
	- **Security**: Many protocols include encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data as it moves across a network.
- **Example protocols**:
	- **HTTP**: Used for transmitting web pages.
	- **TCP/IP**: The fundamental protocol suite for internet communication.
	- **FTP**: Used for transferring files between a client and server.
	- **SMTP**: Used for sending emails.

### Elements of protocol
Protocols used in network communications define:
- **Message Encoding**: Message encoding is the process of converting data into a format that can be transmitted over a network.
  (Protocols like ASCII or Unicode are used for encoding text, while audio and video have their own encoding standards (e.g., MP3, MPEG).)
- **Message Formatting & Encapsulation**:
	- **Message Formatting**: Refers to the specific structure that a message must follow 
	  to be properly understood by the receiving system. It involves organizing the 
	  data into sections such as headers, footers, and payloads.
	  For instance, an email protocol like SMTP has a header (sender, receiver, subject) and a body (message content).
	- **Encapsulation**: This refers to wrapping data with protocol-specific information as 
	  it moves through different layers of the network (according to the OSI model).
	  For example, when sending data over the internet, a message is encapsulated 
	  with IP headers, then TCP/UDP headers, and finally, the application-specific headers (like HTTP).
	  At each step, new information is added to help the message reach its destination and be understood properly.
- **Message Timing**: Message timing refers to when and how fast data is sent between devices.
	- **Flow Control**: Ensures that data is sent at a rate that the receiver can handle, preventing data loss or overload.
	- **Response Time**: iming protocols define how quickly a receiver must acknowledge receipt of a message, preventing unnecessary delays.
	- **Synchronization**: iming protocols define how quickly a receiver must acknowledge receipt of a message, preventing unnecessary delays.
- **Message Size**: Message size refers to how large a data packet can be when sent across the network.
  Different networks have limits on how much data can be transmitted at once. For example, 
  Ethernet networks often use a maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of around 1500 bytes.
- **Message Delivery Options**: This refers to how data is delivered to the recipient. There are three primary options:
	- **Unicast**: Data is sent from one sender to one specific receiver. This is the most common form of communication, such as sending an email or visiting a website.
	- **Multicast**: Data is sent from one sender to multiple specific receivers. An example is streaming media to multiple users in a private group.
	- **Broadcast**: Data is sent from one sender to all devices on a network. This is often used in local networks to send data like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.

## Peer to Peer Network
A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is a type of computer network where each device (or node) 
has equal responsibilities and capabilities, allowing them to communicate directly 
with one another without relying on a central server. In P2P networks, devices act 
as both clients and servers, meaning they can both request and provide resources, 
such as files, data, or services.
- No centralized administration
- All peers are equal
- Simple sharing applications
- Not scalable

## Client Server Network
A Client-Server Network is a network architecture in which there is a clear distinction 
between devices (or nodes) called clients and a central device called the server. 
In this model, clients request services, resources, or data, and the server provides them. 
The client-server model is widely used in many applications, such as websites, 
email systems, and databases.

**Key Characteristics**
- **Centralized Control**: In a client-server network, one or more servers act as centralized points for managing resources, such as files, databases, applications, or services.
- **Request-Response Model**: Clients send requests to the server for services, such as accessing a web page, querying a database, or sending an email.
  The server processes these requests and responds with the necessary information or action. For example, if a client requests a file, the server will send it back to the client.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**:
	- **Server**: The server is a powerful computer or group of computers that handle requests from clients. It provides services such as file storage, email handling, or web hosting. Servers usually run specialized software designed to manage network resources efficiently.
	- **Client**: The client is any device (e.g., a PC, smartphone, or tablet) that connects to the server to access resources or perform tasks. Clients rely on the server to process requests and provide the required services or data.
- **Efficiency and Resource Sharing**: Servers consolidate resources such as databases, applications, files, and printers, allowing multiple clients to access and share these resources efficiently.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is scalable because more clients can connect 
  to the server as needed. Servers can also be upgraded (e.g., adding more storage, memory, 
  or processing power) to handle growing demand.

# CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
Computer networks can be classified based on their geographic coverage, size, 
and the purpose they serve. The most common classifications are LAN (Local Area Network), 
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network). 
Each type has distinct characteristics in terms of size, speed, and technology used.

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
	- **Definition**: A Local Area Network is a network that covers a small geographic area, such as a single building, office, or home. It is typically used to connect computers and devices within close proximity for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections.
	- **Characteristics**
		- **Geographic Area**: Limited to a small area (e.g., a room, a building, or a campus).
		- **Speed**: High-speed networks (ranging from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or more).
		- **Technology**: Common technologies include Ethernet (wired LAN) and Wi-Fi (wireless LAN).

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
	- **Definition**: A Metropolitan Area Network is a network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN, typically the size of a city or a metropolitan region. It interconnects multiple LANs within a city or town, allowing for resource sharing across larger distances.
	- **Characteristics**
		- **Geographic Area**: Covers an area of a few kilometers to tens of kilometers, typically within a city or a large town.
		- **Speed**: Slower than a LAN but typically faster than a WAN, often using fiber-optic or high-speed wireless links.
		- **Technology**: Technologies like Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), or wireless broadband.
		- **Example**: A network that connects multiple offices of a company across a city.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
	- **Definition**: A Wide Area Network covers a much larger geographic area than both LANs and MANs. WANs are used to connect multiple LANs or MANs over cities, countries, or even continents. The most well-known example of a WAN is the Internet.
	- **Characteristics**
		- **Geographic Area**: Covers very large distances, potentially spanning entire countries or continents.
		- **Speed**: Generally slower than LANs
		- **Technology**: WANs use technologies such as leased lines, satellite links, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), and fiber-optic communication.
		- **Example**: The Internet is the largest WAN, connecting billions of devices globally.

# BASICS OF IP ADDRESSING
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to 
devices (nodes) connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
It serves two main functions:

- **Host or Network Identification**: It uniquely identifies a device on a network, such as a computer, 
  smartphone, or server.
- **Location Addressing**: It provides the device's location in the network, enabling data to 
  be routed to and from it.

There are two versions of IP addresses:
- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: Uses a **32-bit** address format, typically represented 
  as four **decimal** numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: Uses a 128-bit address format, written as eight 
  groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons 
  (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

## IP Address (IPV4) Key characteristics
- **Logical address**: IP addresses are considered logical addresses because they 
  don't directly correspond to the physical hardware of a device, but rather 
  provide an abstract way to identify and communicate with devices on a network.
  An IP address can be assigned, changed, or reassigned without modifying the physical device. 
  It's a software-level abstraction.

  For example, imagine we have a local network in New Delhi and another in Italy. 
  By changing the IP address of one of the devices in New Delhi, we can make it
  part of the network in Italy. This shows how IP addresses are flexible and can 
  be reconfigured to allow a device to join a different network, without any 
  changes to the physical hardware.
- **Can change based on the locazion of the device** 
- **The IP is assigned either manually or dynamically**
- **IPV4 addresses are rappresented in decimal and it has 4 octets (x.x.x.x)**
- **"Each value can range from 0 to 255. So all the possible IP addresses go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.**

# BASICS OF MAC ADDRESSING
MAC addressing (Media Access Control addressing) refers to the unique identifier 
assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use in communications within a network segment.
Is typically a **48-bit** number. It is represented as 12 hexadecimal digits, often displayed in six pairs separated by colons or hyphens 
A MAC address **is a hardware address that identifies a specific device** on a local network.
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the hel of MAC address.
Using an analogy:
- IP Address = Location of a person.
- MAC Address = Name of the person 

## Key characteristics
- **Unique Identifier**: A MAC address is typically assigned by the manufacturer of the NIC and is designed to be globally unique, ensuring that no two devices have the same MAC address.
- **Static Address (Hardware Address)**: Unlike IP addresses, which are logical and can be changed, MAC addresses are generally static and hardcoded into the device's hardware. However, some devices and network interfaces allow MAC addresses to be changed in software, a process known as MAC address spoofing.
- **Format**: It is usually represented as **12 hexadecimal digits**, grouped in pairs separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E or 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E).
- **Layer 2 Address**: MAC addresses operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They are used for communication within a local area network (LAN), where devices use MAC addresses to send data to one another on the same network segment.

## Role in Networking
- MAC addresses are used to direct packets to specific devices within a local network. When a device sends data, it includes both the source and destination MAC addresses to ensure the packet reaches the correct device.
- On a larger scale (e.g., across different networks), MAC addresses are not used directly for routing, as that is the role of IP addresses at the Network Layer (Layer 3).
- Note: **Routers** need IP addresses (for routing data between networks), while **switches** need MAC addresses (to direct data within a local network).

## IP Address Vs MAC Address
| Feature                | MAC Address                           | IP Address                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Unique identifier for a network interface | Logical address for a device on a network |
| **Length**             | 48 bits (6 bytes)                    | 32 bits (IPv4) or 128 bits (IPv6)   |
| **Format**             | 12 hexadecimal digits (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`) | 4 decimal numbers for IPv4 (e.g., `192.168.0.1`) or 8 hexadecimal groups for IPv6 (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`) |
| **Assigned by**        | Manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC) | Network administrator or dynamically assigned by DHCP |
| **Scope**              | Local network (Data Link Layer)      | Network-wide (Network Layer)         |
| **Static/Dynamic**     | Generally static (hardcoded)         | Can be dynamic or static              |
| **Purpose**            | Identifies a specific device on a local network | Routes data between devices across networks |
| **Changeability**      | Can be changed through software (MAC spoofing) | Can be changed by reconfiguring the network settings |


# BASICS OF PORT ADDRESSING (PORT NUMBERS)
Imagine a friend wants to send you a package:
- **Reaching Our City (IP Address)**: Your friend first needs to determine the city where you live. This is like finding your network using your IP address. Just as a package must reach the correct city to be delivered, data must reach the right network.
- **Reaching Our Apartment (MAC Address)**: Once the package arrives in your city, it needs to get to your specific apartment. This is similar to how data packets use the MAC address to identify the host device on the local network. Just as the apartment number ensures the package is delivered to your home, the MAC address ensures data reaches the correct device.
- **Reaching the Right Person (Port Address)**: Finally, when the package is at your apartment, it needs to be delivered to you personally. This is akin to using a port address to identify the specific application or process on your device that should receive the data. Just like your friend needs to ensure the package is given to you and not someone else in your apartment, data needs to reach the right process on your device.

## Definition
Port addressing is an essential concept in computer networking that allows multiple 
network services to operate simultaneously on a single IP address. 
Each service running on a device is identified by a port number, which **specifies the particular process or service that should handle incoming or outgoing data**.
- In a node, many processes will be running
- Data which are sent/received must reach the right process
- Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port NUMBERS
- Port = Comunication endpoint
- We have two categories of port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535:
	- Fixed (Well-Known) Port Numbers (e.g., 25, 80)
	- Dynamic Port Numbers: For example, when you open a browser, the operating 
	system assigns a port to the process, such as 62414.

## Understanding the Basics of Port Addressing
- **Port Number**: A port number is a 16-bit integer ranging from 0 to 65535. It helps distinguish different services or applications on a device.
- **Transport Layer Protocols**: Port numbers are primarily used with transport 
  layer protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Well-Known (Fixed) Ports**: Ranging from 0 to 1023, these ports are reserved for widely used protocols and services. Only privileged processes (typically those run by the system) can bind to these ports.
  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has designated certain port numbers for specific services:
	- Port 80: HTTP (web traffic)
	- Port 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic)
	- Port 25: SMTP (email sending)
	- Port 53: DNS (domain name system)
- **Registered Ports**: Ranging from 1024 to 49151, these ports are used for 
	  user applications that are not as widely recognized as those using well-known ports.

## Three Key Points to Ponder
Before sending the data, any node must:
- Attach source IP address and destination IP address (Required for the Routers)
- Attach source MAC address and destination MAC address (Required for the switches)
- Attach source port number and destination port number (Required for the Operating system to hand over the right data to the right process)


# SWITCHING IN COMPUTER NETWORKS
Switching in computer networks is a method used to forward data from one device to another through intermediate nodes or devices.
It helps in deciding the best route for data transmission if there are 
multiple path in a larger network.

Switching involves deciding how data should be routed through the network based on various criteria, like the destination address, current network conditions, or transmission requirements.

# Switching techniques
The three main types of switching techniques are 
- **circuit switching** 
- **message switching**
- **packet switching**

**Packet switching** can be categorized into two approaches:
- Datagram Approach
- Virtual Circuit Approach

Each one has unique characteristics in how data is transmitted across a network.

## Circuit Switching
-**Definition**: Circuit switching is a method where a **dedicated communication path** or circuit is established between two devices for the duration of a communication session.

- **How it works** When data needs to be transmitted, **a** complete end-to-end **connection is established first**. The entire bandwidth of this dedicated path is reserved for the communication until the session ends.

- **Examle**: Traditional telephone networks use circuit switching.

- **Phases in circuit switching**
    - 1. Connection establishment
    - 2. Data transfer
    - 3. Connection Disconnection



## Message Switching
-**Definition**: In message switching, data is sent in the form of complete messages (Store and forward mechanism) from the source to the destination, but no dedicated path is required.

- **How it works**: A message is transmitted from one switch (or node) to the next in separate segments. Each node stores the entire message before forwarding it, a process known as store-and-forward. If the next node is busy or unavailable, the message is temporarily held at the intermediate node until it can be forwarded.

- **Examle**: Early postal services and telegraph systems were similar to message switching.


## Packet Switching:
-**Definition**: Packet switching divides data into small, manageable chunks called packets that are transmitted independently across the network.

- **How it works**: Each packet is routed individually, possibly taking different paths to reach the destination. Each packet will have source and destination IP address with sequence number. Once all packets arrive, they are reassembled into the original message.

- **Examle**: The Internet uses packet switching.

### two approaches in packet switching
In packet switching, data is divided into small units called packets for transmission across a network. There are two main approaches for handling these packets: the datagram approach and the virtual circuit approach. Both of these techniques manage how packets are routed through the network but differ significantly in their implementation and characteristics.
#### Datagram Approach
The datagram approach treats each packet independently, with no predefined path established between the sender and receiver.
- Datagram Packet Switching is also known as connectionaless switching
- Each independent entity is colled as datagram
- Datagrams contain destination information and the intermediary devices uses this information to forward datagrams to right destination
- Every packet is treated as a separate entity. Routers forward packets based on the information contained in each one.
- Intermediate nodes take the routin decisions to forward the packets
- Dynamic Routing: As the network conditions (such as traffic congestion) change, packets can take different paths, leading to more flexibility in routing (The path is not fixed)

#### Virtual Circuit Approach
In the virtual circuit approach, a logical path is established between the sender and receiver before any packets are sent. All packets follow this predetermined path, resembling a connection-oriented system, but without the need for a physical dedicated circuit.
- Virtual Circuit switching is also known as connextion-oriented switching
- In the case of virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is enstablished befor the message are sent. 
Before sending data, a virtual circuit is established, which defines the path all packets will take. This setup phase involves assigning a virtual circuit identifier (VCI) at each hop along the path.
- Call request and call accept packets are used to enstablish the connection between sender and receiver
- nce the path is established, packets travel the same route and can be delivered in order.
- In this approach the path is fixed for the duration of a logical 
- After the communication ends, the virtual circuit is torn down, freeing up network resources.


# LAYERING IN COMPUTER NETWORKS
layering is a design principle that **divides the complex process of data communication into manageable layers**. Each layer performs specific functions and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. This approach simplifies network design, troubleshooting, and development by allowing layers to be developed independently.
The most widely used model that illustrates layering is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, but the TCP/IP model is also commonly referenced in practice.

# Role of protocols in layering
- In computer networking, protocols are essential rules or standards that dictate how data is transmitted and received across a network. They define how devices communicate at various layers of the network. Protocols enable different layers in a layered model (such as the OSI or TCP/IP model) to perform their specific functions and ensure interoperability between systems and devices.
- The protocol in each layer governs the activities of the data communication

# THE OSI MODEL
- OSI stands for Open System Interconnection
- It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is flexible, robust. and interoperable.
- The OSI model is non a protocol, it is only a guideline and hence it is referred as OSI reference model
- The purpose of th OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardare and sofware
- The OSI model was never fully implemented

The OSI model has seven layers, each with distinct responsibilities. Here’s a breakdown of these layers, starting from the bottom (Layer 1) to the top (Layer 7):

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**:
    - **Purpose**: The physical layer deals with the transmission of raw data (bits) over a physical medium like cables, radio waves, or fiber optics.
    - **Functions**:
        - Defines the electrical/optical specifications for devices.
        - Manages how data is physically transmitted (e.g., voltage levels, signal timing).
        - Examples: Ethernet cables, hubs, Wi-Fi standards.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**:
    - **Purpose**: This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction over the physical medium.
    - **Functions**:
        - Packages raw bits into frames for transmission.
        - Adds a **MAC address** (unique hardware address) to ensure data is delivered to the correct device on the same network.
        - Manages error detection (using checksums or CRC).
        - Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), switches.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**:
    - **Purpose**: The network layer handles **routing** data between devices on different networks.
    - **Functions**:
        - Breaks data into packets.
        - Adds **IP addresses** for devices and routes packets across different networks.
        - Decides the best path (route) for data to reach its destination.
        - Handles fragmentation and reassembly of packets.
        - Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**:
    - **Purpose**: The transport layer ensures reliable data transmission between devices, providing end-to-end communication.
    - **Functions**:
        - Breaks data into segments and ensures reliable delivery using mechanisms like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
        - Provides error recovery and flow control to prevent network congestion
        - Supports connection-oriented (TCP) or connectionless (UDP) communication.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**:
    - **Purpose**: The session layer manages sessions between applications.
    - **Functions**:
        - Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections (sessions) between two communicating devices.
        - Manages synchronization of data exchange.
        - Ensures the session stays open for the duration of communication.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**:
    - **Purpose**: The presentation layer is responsible for data translation and **formatting**.
    - **Functions**:
        - Converts data into a format the application layer can understand (e.g., encryption, compression, or data encoding like ASCII or JPEG).
        - Ensures data is presented in a usable format for the application layer.
        - Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**:
    - **Purpose**: This layer provides services directly to end users or applications.
    - **Functions**:
        - Interfaces with the network at the user level.
        - Provides protocols for email, web browsing, file transfer, etc.
        - Handles data exchange between software applications.
        - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

# THE TCP/IP MODEL
- TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model
- Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model
- TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality
(For any comunication to happen in computer network, we need IP address, MAC address and port address. Each layer wil take care of each of these addressing.)

While the OSI model is a conceptual model, the TCP/IP model is a more practical framework used in the real world, especially for the Internet. It consists of four layers (sometimes five, depending on interpretation):

1. **Link Layer**
    - **Purpose**: The link layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices, including how data is physically transmitted over the network (such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
    This layer encompasses what the Physical and Data Link layers do in the OSI model. It manages how data is physically transmitted and received, including error detection and hardware addressing.
    - **Functions**:
        - Framing: Divides data into frames for transmission across the physical network.
        - Addressing: Uses hardware (**MAC**) addresses to identify devices on the same local network.
        - Error Detection: Provides mechanisms to detect errors in frames during transmission (e.g., checksums or CRC).
        - Medium Access Control: Controls how devices share the network medium, avoiding collisions (especially in wireless or shared networks).

2. **Internet Layer**
    - **Purpose**: The Internet layer is responsible for routing data between devices across multiple networks (e.g., from your local network to a server on the Internet). It determines the best path for data to reach its destination.
    - **Functions**:
        - Packet Routing: Decides how packets (small chunks of data) travel across the network, hopping from router to router until they reach their destination.
        - Addressing: Assigns **IP addresses** to identify devices uniquely across the network.
        - Fragmentation and Reassembly: Breaks large packets into smaller chunks that fit the network’s limits and reassembles them at the destination.

3. **Transport Layer**
    - **Purpose**: The transport layer manages **end-to-end communication** between devices. It ensures that data is transmitted reliably (or unreliably, depending on the protocol) and in the correct sequence.
    - **Functions**:
        - Segmentation: Divides data into smaller units (segments) for transmission and reassembles them at the destination.
        - Error Control: Ensures that corrupted or missing data is detected and retransmitted.
        - Flow Control: Manages the rate of data transmission to avoid overwhelming the network or the receiver.
        - Multiplexing: Allows multiple applications on the same device to send and receive data simultaneously.

4. **Application Layer**:
    - **Purpose**: The application layer provides network services directly to user applications. It defines the protocols that applications use to communicate over the network, handling the user’s data.
    - **Functions**:
        - Data Presentation: Ensures that data is formatted and presented correctly for the application, such as converting it into readable formats.
        - Application Services: Provides services like file transfer, email, and web browsing.
        - Protocol Interaction: Enables interaction between different networked applications using protocols like HTTP, SMTP, etc.
